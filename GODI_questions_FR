### What is the Global Open Data Index?
The Global Open Data Index is Open Knowledge annual benchmark for open government data publication. It measures the openness of 15 datasets and compares them against to the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/). Read more about it on the [methodology](LINK) page

### What period does GODI refer to?


### What is Open Data according to the Open Definition?
The Open Definition stipulates that data is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it — subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness. Read the full text of the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/) 

### Why do you have a dialogue phase? 
In the past years, we have published the Index as a timely limited snapshot of open data and added an errata section to record mistakes in the evaluation. Last year, we reached out to governments to comment on our review before the official launch. This year, we decided to use the launch to initiate a public dialogue phase and reach more government. We also hope that an open dialogue allows data publishers and users to exchange viewpoints and learn from one another, and enables the publication of more meaningful open data.
